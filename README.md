**Password Security Checker Using CLI**

**Description:**

The Password Security Checker is a Python script designed to enhance online security by allowing users to verify the strength of their passwords. By taking a password as input via the command line, the script hashes the password and queries an external API to check how many times the password has been previously used or exposed in data breaches.

**Key Features:**

1. **Password Hashing:** The script employs secure hashing algorithms to convert the user's password into a hashed format. This ensures that the actual password is not transmitted over the network.

2. **API Integration:** Utilizing a designated API, the script queries the database to check if the hashed password has been previously compromised or is part of known data breaches.

3. **Password Exposure Check:** The API response informs the user of the number of times the password has been detected in previous breaches, allowing them to assess its security level.

4. **User-Friendly Command Line Interface:** The script provides a simple and intuitive command line interface, enabling users to check their passwords without complex technical knowledge.

**How It Works:**

1. The user runs the script via the command line and inputs the password they want to check.

2. The script securely hashes the password using a strong hashing algorithm, ensuring that the original password is never transmitted or stored.

3. The hashed password is sent to the external API for verification.

4. The API returns a response with information about the number of times the hashed password has been found in data breaches, indicating the potential risk level.

5. The script displays the result to the user, helping them make informed decisions about their password's security.

**Benefits:**

- **Enhanced Password Security:** Users can quickly assess the security of their passwords and take action to strengthen them if necessary.

- **Protection Against Data Breaches:** By identifying compromised passwords, users can change them and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

- **User Empowerment:** The tool empowers users to take proactive measures to protect their online accounts and personal data.

**Future Enhancements:**

1. **Local Database:** Implementing a local database to store and query hashed passwords, reducing the need for external API calls and enhancing privacy.

2. **Password Recommendations:** Offering password improvement suggestions to guide users in creating stronger passwords.

3. **Integration with Password Managers:** Integrating the tool with password management software for seamless security checks.

The Password Security Checker script is a valuable tool for individuals seeking to safeguard their online accounts and confidential information. By harnessing the power of password hashing and external breach databases, it empowers users to make informed decisions about their online security.
